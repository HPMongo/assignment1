Bio

My name is Huy Pham. I'm currently on my 4th term (on a 2-year track). I'm currently an IT Analyst for Principal Financial Group where my focus is on developing and maintaining software (mostly for mainframe applications) that supports life insurance administration. 

I have a BS in Management Information System and Finance from Iowa State University and an MBA from University of Iowa. My main goals for the program are to help me further my technical knowledge and to build a solid foundation so that I could continue with a Master in CS once I'm done with this program. 

One interesting fact, I'm actually on vacation and half-way around the world right now (in Vietnam). 12 hours difference is quite interesting to adjust to but I do enjoy the warm weather and the variety of foods that they have here.

Programming background:
    COBOL, JCL, SQL, C/C++, MASM
